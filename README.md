# 🧬 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📍 Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes using medical data and machine learning classification techniques. The dataset used is the well-known **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on patient health metrics.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.
- Identify the most important features contributing to the prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM)

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling zero values and missing data.
2. **EDA** – Analyze trends in glucose, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
3. **Model Training** – Apply multiple ML algorithms.
4. **Evaluation** – Use accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix.

## 📊 Sample Output
```bash
Model: Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 81%
Confusion Matrix:
[[120  10]
 [ 20  44]]
